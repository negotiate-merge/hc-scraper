# Hot Copper - Forum post web scraper by user

## To Do list
- Rewrite find_posts so that it uses accurate datetime objects. COMPLETED
- Save the json output for each year so that it can be fed in to other systems (LLM)
- Incorporate a better form of logging so that edge case errors are easier to pin point and rectify. 
  We want to know exactly where the scraper crashed so we can recommence from that point when the fix is made.
